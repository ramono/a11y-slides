Intro
- Disclaimers:
  - Not a live coding session, sorry to disappoint
  - We can expand on this if you guys want to have a more technical session with a case study and more specific code samples

- Been working a front end developer, now tech lead and helping our team grow our accessibility knowledge
- We help companies transition to a more efficient work flow and effective online presence

Whats & Whys
- People clinically blind, or deaf or with motor impediments, also people with cognitive disabilities like dyslexia for example, or even temporary
like an accident, maternity, etc
- Perceivable, elements of the app are easily recognised
- Understandable, that the controls and elements make sense for them
- Operable, user able to trigger actions where needed
- Robust, survive against different environments and conditions, like a phone in the sun, or able to be used with a screen reader

- Inclusivity is more when you add multiple languages to make sure users understand your content, or details like a flexible or comprehensive gender selector
- Universal Design, close but is more about approaching design challenges in ways that yield products that directly work better for everybody

Level
- Level can update requirements on a previous level, like colour contrast, on AA is 4.5:1 and in level AAA is 7:1
- Show contrast ratio

Important
- Colorado law recently passed requires public service websites to comply
- There might always be somewhere else users can go, so it's likely also your loss

It fits
- Design is one of the most important aspects, specially UX design because it indicates how the product should work, not only the way it looks

Landmarks
- Asistive technologies can have an array of tools to help users navigate complex pages, including identifying specific areas by landmark, or page structure by headings, and also lists of links

Aria
- With values true or false to identify state
- With a string or the ID value of another element

- Skip link allows keyboard and screen reader users not have to tab/read through a long list of elements every time they land on a page

CSS
- We control how the page looks and many times how it behaves
- Sometimes aria-label works better 
- Font styling may apply to the font choice itself, look at what heppened to twitter recently where the new font was giving some users headaches
- Some users (specially with Dyslexia) will apply custom styling to websites to change the font to a monospaced version and increase the letter spacing and line-height.

JS
- Change state, tabs, accordions, toggable elements, pagination
- Focus, like opening and closing a dialog, ensure people are not tabbibg through invisible parts
- Animation can be very distracting for people with ADHD
- Alerts, use CSS + JS to change its status
- Aria live for a live-update feature on articles
- Widgets, sometimes they try and fail
